Adjust the mountain\'92s lighting to reflect cool moonlight illumination, with subtle highlights along the ridges and darker shadows across the slopes. Modify the water reflection accordingly so it mirrors the night sky and moonlight consistently, maintaining realistic light balance, atmospheric depth, and natural nighttime color grading."
img2.jpg,"On each cupcake, precisely place a single, whole, ripe strawberry on the very center of the green cream swirl, ensuring the strawberry’s stem end points upward and its curved body conforms gently to the peak of the frosting. The strawberry should be positioned so that its red surface is fully visible and its green calyx remains intact, creating a natural, fresh contrast against the pale green frosting. Maintain the existing height, texture, and shape of the cream swirl beneath the strawberry; do not alter the frosting’s volume or form. Ensure the strawberry’s placement is symmetrical and centered relative to each cupcake’s base, and confirm that no part of the strawberry obscures the underlying cake or liner. Preserve the lighting and shadowing on the strawberry to match the original scene’s soft, directional illumination, allowing subtle highlights on the fruit’s glossy surface to enhance its realism. The strawberries should appear freshly added, with no artificial sheen or unnatural coloration, and must remain fully attached to the cream without any visual distortion or blending artifacts."
