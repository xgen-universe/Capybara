video2.mp4,"Add a black fascinator with a feather to the woman’s head, positioning it slightly to the left side of her forehead, where it should appear as if it is elegantly perched atop her hairline, blending seamlessly with her styled red hair. The fascinator should feature a structured black base with a single, long, dark-feathered plume extending downward and slightly to the right, creating a dynamic yet refined silhouette. Ensure the fascinator’s texture and material appear realistic under the scene’s lighting, with subtle shadows cast beneath the base and feather to enhance depth and dimensionality. Maintain the woman’s existing pose, facial expression, and hairstyle—do not alter her head tilt, eye direction, or hair volume. Preserve the reflective quality of the floor and the deep blue background, ensuring the fascinator’s silhouette casts a faint, natural shadow onto her forehead and the surrounding hair. The fascinator should appear as if it is part of the original composition, with no visible seams, distortions, or unnatural edges."
